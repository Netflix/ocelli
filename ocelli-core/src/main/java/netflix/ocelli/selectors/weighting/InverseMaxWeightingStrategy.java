/**
 * Weighting strategy that gives an inverse weight to the highest rate.  Using
 * this strategy higher input values receive smaller weights. 
 * 
 * For example, if the weight is based on pending requests then an input of
 * [1, 5, 10, 1] pending request counts would yield the following weights
 * [10, 6, 1, 10] using the formula : w(i) = max - w(i) + 1
 * 
 * Note that 1 is added to ensure that we don't have a 0 weight, which is invalid.
